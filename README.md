# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Endless Runner MVP

## üéØ **Core Philosophy: UI/UX First**

> **"UI and UX is paramount - alongside gameplay, it's the most critical element of any modern app."**

This project follows the **UI/UX-First Development Principle**, where every feature, every interaction, and every visual element is designed with the user experience as the top priority. We believe that exceptional gameplay means nothing without an exceptional interface that feels modern, responsive, and intuitive across all devices.
