## Code Extraction Strategy

### For each feature:
1. Find the feature code in `index_v4.5.9_all_features.html`
2. Extract into a separate module file
3. Remove dependencies on broken systems
4. Test in isolation
5. Integrate into main game
6. Test again
7. Commit with descriptive message

### Example: Extracting Level 2
```javascript
// SubwayRunner/features/levels/level2.js
const Level2NeonCity = {
    name: "Neon Night Run",
    id: 2,
    
    init: function(scene) {
        // Extracted createLevel2Environment code
        this.createEnvironment(scene);
        this.setupLighting(scene);
        this.createObstacles();
    },
    
    createEnvironment: function(scene) {
        // Neon city creation code
    },
    
    // ... more methods
};

// Integration in main game:
// if (currentLevel === 2) Level2NeonCity.init(scene);
```

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying any feature:
- [ ] Game starts without errors
- [ ] FPS stays above 30 on low-end devices
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] All controls work
- [ ] Mobile touch controls functional
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Level transitions smooth

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Local Testing**: Full playthrough locally
2. **Staging**: Test on a subdomain if possible
3. **Canary Deploy**: 10% of users first
4. **Full Deploy**: After 24 hours if stable
5. **Rollback Plan**: Keep previous version ready

## Performance Budgets

- Max file size: 15,000 lines (currently 6,800)
- Load time: < 3 seconds
- FPS: Minimum 30, target 60
- Memory: < 500MB usage
- Draw calls: < 1000

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Version Control**: Commit after each successful integration
2. **Feature Flags**: Add toggles for new features
3. **Gradual Rollout**: One feature at a time
4. **User Feedback**: Monitor Discord/forums
5. **Automated Backups**: Daily backups of working versions

## Success Metrics

- Game loads successfully: âœ…
- Original features work: âœ…
- New features integrate smoothly: ðŸ”„
- Performance maintained: ðŸ“Š
- User satisfaction: ðŸ˜Š

## Notes

- **DO NOT** update Three.js from r158
- **DO NOT** add all features at once
- **DO** test thoroughly after each addition
- **DO** maintain code modularity
- **DO** document all changes
