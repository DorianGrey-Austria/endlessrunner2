# SubwayRunner Stabilization Log

## Version: V4.6.2-STABILIZED
## Date: 26.07.2025

### Critical Issues Fixed:
1. âœ… **Fixed `isBoxesIntersecting` undefined error**
   - Replaced with existing `boundingBoxIntersection` function
   - Error was causing 160+ errors per minute
   
2. âœ… **Temporarily disabled Level 2 progression**
   - Commented out `checkLevelProgression()` call
   - Level 2 integration was causing instability
   
3. âœ… **Created pre-deployment test system**
   - `pre-deployment-test.js` - Automated test suite
   - Must be run before EVERY deployment
   - Exit code 0 = safe to deploy, 1 = DO NOT DEPLOY

### Phase 1 Completed:
- [x] Rollback to stable version
- [x] Establish automated test system  
- [x] Code cleanup (kiwiRadius consistency verified)

### Next Steps (Phase 2):
- [ ] Modularize level system properly
- [ ] Increase test coverage
- [ ] Create staging environment

### Test Results:
```
ðŸš€ Quick critical error test...
âœ… Test complete: 0 critical errors found
```

### Deployment Checklist:
1. Run `node pre-deployment-test.js`
2. Verify exit code is 0
3. Check `pre-deployment-report.json`
4. Only deploy if ALL tests pass

### Known Non-Critical Issues:
- Missing background.mp3 (404)
- Supabase table does not exist
- These do NOT affect game functionality

### Lessons Learned:
- ALWAYS test before deployment
- Level integration needs careful planning
- Monolithic 10k+ line files are fragile
- Automated tests catch issues early
