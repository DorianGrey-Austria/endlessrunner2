---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL OPTIMIZATION: Speed Escalation Fix**

### **Problem Statement (Nov 2, 2025)**
**Current Behavior**: Game speed increases exponentially throughout 10 levels, becoming unplayable by the end.

**Desired Behavior**:
- **Level 1 Speed**: 0.08 baseSpeed (starting speed)
- **Levels 1-5**: Progressive speed increase (125% → 175%)
- **Levels 6-10**: Gradual speed curve flattening (asymptotic approach)
- **Level 10 FINAL TARGET**: Speed stays constant at ~0.16 (200% of base)
- **Design Intent**: User plays all 10 levels, masters the SAME speed they'll face in endless mode

**Current Issues**:
1. `speedMultiplier` grows exponentially instead of linearly
2. No speed cap after certain level thresholds
3. End-game speed is 2-3x higher than intended
4. Player cannot control character at higher speeds (collision/reflex issues)
5. Speed never plateaus - keeps escalating indefinitely

**Solution Approach** (using BMAD Agents):
- **Phase 1**: Level Balance Analyst analyzes progression curve
- **Phase 2**: Data Analyst calculates optimal speed formula
- **Phase 3**: Technical Evaluator plans implementation
- **Phase 4**: Implement and test new curve

**Target Speed Progression** (Goal):
```
Level 1:  0.08 (100%) ← Starting point
Level 2:  0.10 (125%) ← Warmup
Level 3:  0.12 (150%) ← Ramping up
Level 4:  0.13 (162%)
Level 5:  0.14 (175%) ← Midpoint (half difficulty)
Level 6:  0.15 (187%) ← Curve starts flattening
Level 7:  0.155 (194%)
Level 8:  0.16 (200%) ← Approaching asymptote
Level 9:  0.16 (200%) ← Held stable
Level 10: 0.16 (200%) ← FINAL TARGET (hold for endless)
```

**Expected Impact**:
- ✅ All 10 levels remain playable & fair
- ✅ Difficulty progression feels natural & skill-based
- ✅ Final level (Level 10) = Endless mode speed
- ✅ Speed stops escalating - gives players time to master
- ✅ Better player retention (not frustrated by impossible speed)
