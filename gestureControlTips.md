## 4. Implementation Code for Endless Runner

### Head Tilt Detection (Left/Right Movement)

```javascript
class HeadGestureController {
  constructor() {
    // Production-tested thresholds
    this.thresholds = {
      leftTurn: -15,    // degrees
      rightTurn: 15,    // degrees
      neutralZone: 10,  // degrees
      jump: -20,        // pitch up
      duck: 25          // pitch down
    };
    
    // Smoothing setup
    this.yawFilter = new KalmanFilter({ R: 0.01, Q: 3 });
    this.pitchFilter = new KalmanFilter({ R: 0.01, Q: 3 });
  }
  
  processLandmarks(landmarks) {
    // Calculate yaw from eye positions
    const leftEye = landmarks[33];
    const rightEye = landmarks[263];
    const yaw = this.calculateYaw(leftEye, rightEye);
    
    // Calculate pitch from nose and forehead
    const noseTip = landmarks[1];
    const forehead = landmarks[10];
    const pitch = this.calculatePitch(noseTip, forehead);
    
    // Apply Kalman filtering
    const smoothYaw = this.yawFilter.filter(yaw);
    const smoothPitch = this.pitchFilter.filter(pitch);
    
    return this.detectGesture(smoothYaw, smoothPitch);
  }
  
  detectGesture(yaw, pitch) {
    let gesture = 'center';
    
    // Horizontal movement
    if (yaw < this.thresholds.leftTurn) {
      gesture = 'left';
    } else if (yaw > this.thresholds.rightTurn) {
      gesture = 'right';
    }
    
    // Vertical gestures (with cooldown)
    if (pitch < this.thresholds.jump && this.canJump()) {
      return 'jump';
    } else if (pitch > this.thresholds.duck && this.canDuck()) {
      return 'duck';
    }
    
    return gesture;
  }
}
```

### Smoothing and Noise Reduction

```javascript
// Kalman filter for 99% reliability
class KalmanFilter {
  constructor(params = {}) {
    this.R = params.R || 0.01; // Measurement noise
    this.Q = params.Q || 3;    // Process noise
    this.A = 1;
    this.B = 0;
    this.C = 1;
    this.x = 0;  // Initial state
    this.P = 1;  // Initial covariance
    this.u = 0;  // Control input
  }
  
  filter(measurement) {
    // Prediction
    const predictedX = this.A * this.x + this.B * this.u;
    const predictedP = this.A * this.P * this.A + this.Q;
    
    // Update
    const K = predictedP * this.C / (this.C * predictedP * this.C + this.R);
    this.x = predictedX + K * (measurement - this.C * predictedX);
    this.P = (1 - K * this.C) * predictedP;
    
    return this.x;
  }
}
```

### Mobile Optimization

```javascript
class MobileOptimizedTracker {
  constructor() {
    this.frameSkipper = new FrameSkipper(15); // 15 FPS on mobile
    this.resolution = this.getOptimalResolution();
  }
  
  getOptimalResolution() {
    const isMobile = /Android|iPhone/i.test(navigator.userAgent);
    return isMobile ? 
      { width: 320, height: 240 } : 
      { width: 640, height: 480 };
  }
  
  async processFrame(video) {
    if (!this.frameSkipper.shouldProcess()) return null;
    
    // Use quantized model for mobile
    const detection = await this.quantizedModel.detect(video);
    return detection;
  }
}
```

## 5. Achieving 99% Reliability

### Multi-Tiered Fallback System

```javascript
class ReliableGestureSystem {
  constructor() {
    this.trackingModes = ['advanced', 'basic', 'fallback'];
    this.currentMode = 'advanced';
    this.performanceMonitor = new PerformanceMonitor();
  }
  
  async detectGesture(video) {
    try {
      // Primary detection
      const result = await this.primaryDetection(video);
      
      if (result.confidence > 0.7) {
        this.performanceMonitor.recordSuccess();
        return result.gesture;
      }
      
      // Fallback to basic mode
      return await this.basicDetection(video);
      
    } catch (error) {
      // Ultimate fallback to touch/keyboard
      this.activateFallbackControls();
      return null;
    }
  }
  
  monitorPerformance() {
    const metrics = this.performanceMonitor.getMetrics();
    
    if (metrics.successRate < 0.9) {
      this.degradeTrackingMode();
    }
  }
}
```

### Calibration for Individual Users

```javascript
class UserCalibration {
  async calibrate() {
    // 1. Capture neutral position
    const neutral = await this.captureNeutral();
    
    // 2. Capture range of motion
    const range = await this.captureRange();
    
    // 3. Calculate adaptive thresholds
    this.thresholds = {
      left: range.yawMin * 0.6,
      right: range.yawMax * 0.6,
      jump: range.pitchMin * 0.7,
      duck: range.pitchMax * 0.7
    };
    
    // 4. Store user profile
    localStorage.setItem('headTracking', JSON.stringify({
      neutral,
      thresholds,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    }));
  }
}
```
